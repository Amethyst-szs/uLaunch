# (Unnamed) qlaunch reimplementation

> Custom, open-source replacement for Nintendo Switch's HOME Menu (qlaunch), inspired and mostly based on eQlipse's concept

## Notes

This project is the new, way better reconstruction of eQlipse, the actual first serious attempt to make a custom qlaunch replacement.

The code isn't yet made to be usable or compileable, unless you really know what you're doing.

A lot of stuff needs to be prepared and cleaned, plus many aspects of the project (the name itself, locations, functionality) aren't decided yet.

Due to technical complications (and the chaos its code was) eQlipse was dropped, and after finding new ideas to handle memory constraints, a new reimpl was made from scratch (with some bits from the old code, obviously) which is the code present here.
