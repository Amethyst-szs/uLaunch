# uLaunch's TODO list

- Improve QDaemons's IPC with two services, one only for QMenu and the other one for any process to interact with uLaunch:

  - Easy way to detect whether uLaunch is present

  - Get whether a title/homebrew is opened

- RE controller applet, allow managing controllers same way normal qlaunch does

- Get album working (for some reason album applet won't work...?)
