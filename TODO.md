## TODO

All the stuff to do before first release:

- "All titles" menu

- Polish UI (specially speaking of startup menu)

## Plans

This could be also considered as TODOs, but not really needed for a first release:

- Improve QDaemons's IPC with two services, one only for QMenu and the other one for any process to interact with uLaunch
